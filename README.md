  <!-- Big Ideas -->
  <h1>Big Ideas</h1>
  <p>1. Collaborating: We worked together as a group, shared the tasks, and helped each other solve problems so that no one got stuck with errors.</p>
  <p>2. Program Design & Development: I made simple step-by-step plans, and used easy methods like printing test messages and checking the code in small parts to make the program better.</p>
  <p>3. Program Function & Purpose: I set a clear goal and thought about who would use the program. I organized the input (what the user gives) and the output (what the program shows), divided the program into smaller parts (functions and steps), and carefully wrote everything down so others can understand and reuse it.</p>
  <p>4. Finding & Fixing Mistakes: I made small tests, checked unusual situations, and added simple error controls to stop the program from breaking or giving wrong results.</p>
